        How the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) makes decisions on what is a medicine or medical device (borderline products).
      </p>

      <p>Some products are hard to distinguish from a medicine or a medical device, for example cosmetics, food supplements or biocidal products. These products are called borderline products until their status has been decided.</p>

      <p>MHRA determines whether a product falls within the definition of a medicine – ‘medicinal product’ or a medical device and provides information on whether a product is a medicine or a medical device or not.</p>

      <p>
        If you need help deciding whether your product is a medicine or a medical device, you should email us at <a href="mailto:mail@example.com">mail@example.com</a>.
